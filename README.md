# BrainTeaser

## Written in Go, BrainTeaser is a program that generates a timed quiz of multiple-choice problems from a CSV file. The user has the option of providing their own questions (via a CSV file) and deciding the time limit for their quiz. Once the timer is up, the program tells you how well you scored.
